Features
Generate images from custom text prompts using AI.
Save and view generated images in a gallery.
Adjustable settings for model parameters (if applicable).
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (or your choice of CSS framework)
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
AI Model: (Specify the AI model used, e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
Other Libraries: (Include any additional libraries like Axios, Mongoose, etc.)
